CCC: CCC2: Cause and Effect
Justification: Students must reason about how temperature differences cause water to move, applying observed outcomes to real-world systems like ocean currents.
DOK Level: 3
Justification: Requires interpreting experimental observations to select multiple conclusions about real-world ocean phenomena.

Stimulus:
After learning that deep ocean currents are colder than surface currents, a student wondered if temperature affects how water moves. To test this, they conducted a lab comparing warm and cold water movement in two bottle setups.

[Visual Description:]
Diagram shows two bottle setups:
Setup 1: Warm water over cold water (with red/blue food coloring)
Setup 2: Cold water over warm water

Table summarizes results:
Setup 1: Warm water stays on top
Setup 2: Cold water sinks and mixes

Question:
Which two conclusions about Earth's ocean currents can the students reach from this lab?

A) Temperature difference between air and deep water moves deep ocean currents.
B) Surface currents will be warmer than deep water currents.
C) When surface water in the ocean cools, it sinks and creates currents.
D) Ocean currents must flow in a downward direction.
E) The smaller the water temperature difference, the faster the ocean currents move.

Answer: B, C
Rationale for correct choice(s):
B: The lab shows that warm water remains above colder water, suggesting surface water in oceans is typically warmer than deeper currents.
C: In Setup 2, the cold water sinks and mixes, modeling how cooling surface water sinks and helps drive ocean currents.
Rationale for incorrect choice(s):
A: Air temperature is not part of the lab setup and goes beyond what was tested.

A) The population of mice would decrease.
B) The fox population would not be affected.
C) There would be less food for grasshoppers.
D) The population of rabbits would increase.
E) The bird population would decrease.

Answer: A, C, E

Rationale for correct choice(s):
A: Mice depend on grains for food, so pest damage to grains would reduce their population.
C: Grasshoppers eat grains, so grain loss would lead to less food for them.
E: Birds rely on grasshoppers as a food source, so fewer grasshoppers would reduce bird populations.

Rationale for incorrect choice(s):
B: Foxes eat mice, so a decline in mice would likely affect them too.
D: Rabbits eat grasses and carrots, not grains—this population wouldn't be directly affected.


Item 4: MS: 7.LS2.5
DCI: LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics
SEP: SEP6: Constructing Explanations
Justification: Students evaluate and select solutions based on ecological reasoning and must explain the predicted outcomes of each intervention. This aligns with SEP6, as they are connecting cause and consequence to build a coherent explanation.
CCC: CCC2: Cause and Effect
Justification: The task requires analyzing how human actions (like boat cleaning) directly influence biological outcomes (jellyfish spread and zooplankton levels), making CCC2 central to the reasoning process.
DOK Level: 3
Justification: Requires identifying two viable actions and predicting their ecological consequences.

Stimulus:
Students learned that freshwater jellyfish, an invasive species, are spreading rapidly between lakes by attaching to boats. Because jellyfish eat zooplankton, students are evaluating which strategies could help reduce the spread and protect lake ecosystems.

Question:
Which two solutions would best help stop the spread of the freshwater jellyfish and how would the solution affect zooplankton populations?

[Visual Description:]
Table shows five paired scenarios, each including a possible solution and its predicted effect on zooplankton populations.

A) Solution: Require boats to be cleaned before they are used in different lakes.
Effect on Zooplankton: Jellyfish will not spread to other lakes.
B) Solution: Require boats to be cleaned before they are used in different lakes.
Effect on Zooplankton: Populations will decrease because jellyfish feed on them.
C) Solution: Require people to have a license to drive a boat in lakes.
Effect on Zooplankton: Populations will be more stable because jellyfish do not feed on them.
D) Solution: Require boats to be cleaned before they are used in different lakes.
Effect on Zooplankton: Populations will increase because there will be fewer jellyfish to feed on them.
E) Solution: Require people to have a license to drive a boat in lakes.
Effect on Zooplankton: Populations will decrease because jellyfish feed on them.

Answer: A, D

Rationale for correct choice(s):
A: Cleaning boats helps stop jellyfish from spreading, which prevents them from entering new lakes.
D: If jellyfish are prevented from spreading, zooplankton populations can increase due to reduced predation.

Rationale for incorrect choice(s):
B: Although the solution is valid, the stated effect is incorrect—cleaning boats should help protect zooplankton.
C: Licensing boaters does not affect jellyfish movement or feeding, so it won’t help zooplankton.
E: Licensing also has no ecological impact on jellyfish predation or zooplankton decline.

Justification: students must trace how energy exists in different forms (kinetic, potential, thermal) and understand how it is transferred or stored in everyday situations. It emphasizes the flow and transformation of energy within systems.
DOK Level: 3
Justification: Requires strategic thinking and reasoning to determine the dominant type of energy in each case.

Stimulus:
A student observes that different objects and situations in daily life involve energy in different forms—motion, stored energy, or heat. Use the drag-and-drop tool to sort each scenario based on the main type of energy being demonstrated.

Visual Description:
A drag-and-drop interface with 3 labeled columns:
- Column 1: Kinetic Energy
- Column 2: Potential Energy
- Column 3: Thermal Energy
Draggable scenarios:
- A stretched rubber band before being released
- A child sliding down a playground slide
- A pot heating on a stove burner
- A ball resting at the top of a hill
- A roller coaster in motion
- A metal spoon warming in hot soup

Prompt:
Drag each scenario into the correct column to show whether it demonstrates kinetic, potential, or thermal energy.

Answer:
Kinetic:
- A child sliding down a playground slide
- A roller coaster in motion
Potential:
- A stretched rubber band before being released
- A ball resting at the top of a hill
Thermal:
- A pot heating on a stove burner
- A metal spoon warming in hot soup

Rationale for correct choice(s):
A child sliding and a roller coaster in motion both involve visible movement—this is kinetic energy.
A stretched rubber band and a ball at a height have stored energy due to position or tension—potential energy.
A pot on a stove and a spoon in hot soup are heated through thermal energy transfer.

Rationale for incorrect choice(s):
Misplacing scenarios like the stretched rubber band in kinetic would confuse stored energy with motion.
Placing a spoon warming in kinetic or potential shows confusion between heat transfer and physical movement or height.
Errors reflect misunderstanding of how energy is classified based on observable traits.


## Example 2: Hot-Spot – 6.PS3.2
Item: TE: Hot-Spot – 6.PS3.2
DCI: PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer

DOK Level: 2
Justification: students must interpret a visual model, recognize patterns of heat transfer, and apply conceptual understanding of conduction to select accurate hotspots.

Stimulus:
While camping, a group of friends notice that different things around a fire feel warm in different ways. One student asks: “Where is the heat traveling through touch?” Use the image to select two places where conduction is occurring.

Visual Description:
An illustration of a campfire scene that includes:
- Fire pit with burning logs
- Metal pot over flames
- Marshmallow on a metal skewer
- A person warming hands near the fire
- Rising heat waves drawn above fire

Prompt:
Click on two areas of the image that show where thermal energy is being transferred by conduction.

Answer:
- Metal pot touching the flames
- Metal skewer holding the marshmallow

Rationale for correct choice(s):
The pot and skewer both involve direct metal contact with a heat source—hallmarks of conduction.

Rationale for incorrect choice(s):
Warming hands reflects radiation, not conduction.
Rising heat waves are convection, not conduction.
Selecting these alternatives shows misunderstanding of the required physical contact for conduction.

SEP: SEP6: Constructing Explanations
Justification: Students must determine which scientific mechanism explains each phenomenon and construct an accurate explanation by completing a sentence.
CCC: CCC2: Cause and Effect
Justification: students must identify specific mechanisms of energy transfer and link each observed effect (sand heating, feet warming) to its underlying cause.
DOK Level: 2
Justification: requires students to apply understanding of energy transfer types to a familiar context and select appropriate explanations based on cause-and-effect reasoning.

Stimulus:
After spending the day at the beach, a student notices the sand is hot from the sun—and that it feels even hotter when walking on it barefoot. Complete the sentence to explain how energy is transferred in each part of this situation.

Prompt:
Complete the sentence to explain how energy is transferred in each part of this situation by selecting the correct energy transfer method from the drop-down menus.

Sentence:
When the sun heats the sand on a beach, this is an example of [inline-choice: radiation/conduction/convection].
When you walk on the hot sand and your feet get warm, that is [inline-choice: radiation/conduction/convection].

Answer:
Radiation
Conduction

Rationale for correct choice(s):
Radiation: Solar energy transfers through space without contact.
Conduction: Feet absorb heat by touching the sand, indicating direct thermal transfer.

Rationale for incorrect choice(s):
Convection: Requires fluid movement, not relevant to these scenarios.
Misidentifying conduction or radiation shows confusion between contact-based and wave-based energy transfer.


## Example 4: Graphing – 6.PS3.1
Item: TE: Graphing – 6.PS3.1
DCI: PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer
SEP: SEP2: Developing and Using Models
Justification: Students build a model using a graph to represent dynamic energy exchanges (kinetic and potential) and must structure it to reflect real system behavior.
CCC: CCC5: Energy and Matter
Justification: students must model how energy is transferred and transformed between kinetic and potential forms and recognize that total energy is conserved throughout the system.
DOK Level: 3
Justification: students must develop a dynamic model, analyze changes over time, and apply conceptual understanding of energy conservation and transformation in a real-world context.

Stimulus:
A student watches a ball bounce several times after being dropped. They wonder how the ball’s energy changes each time it rises and falls.

Visual Description:
Interactive graph with:
- X-axis labeled “Time (seconds)”
- Y-axis labeled “Energy (Joules)”
Two editable lines:
- Line 1 (Kinetic Energy) – student plots this
- Line 2 (Potential Energy) – student plots this
Total Energy is not required to be graphed but assumed to be conserved.

Prompt:
Create a graph that models how kinetic and potential energy change over time during the bouncing motion until it comes to rest.

Answer (Expected Graph Features):
- Kinetic Energy: Peaks when the ball hits the ground; valleys when at the top.
- Potential Energy: Peaks when ball is highest; valleys at impact.
- Both lines show decreasing amplitude due to energy transformation into heat.
- Total energy appears conserved with minor losses.

Answer (Scoring Guide):
A correct student-created model will include:
- Alternating PE and KE curves with inverse relationship
- Energy values that diminish gradually over time
- Clear understanding of how PE converts to KE and back
- Total energy visualized as conserved through modeling

Rationale for correct choice(s):
Accurately modeling inverse energy curves demonstrates understanding of transfer and conservation.
Decreasing energy over time suggests correct reasoning about loss to thermal energy.

Rationale for incorrect choice(s):
Flat lines or only one energy type misrepresents transformation.
Total energy increasing over time violates conservation laws.
Misplaced peaks/valleys show lack of understanding of when energy is stored or moving.

B: Establishes presence of natural control in Asia.
C: Shows absence of control in the U.S.

Rationale for incorrect:
A: Describes beetle biology, not ecosystem relationships.
D: Relates to human management, not ecological dynamics.
E: Irrelevant to predator interaction.

### Stimulus (Part 2):
In Tennessee, the EAB was discovered in 2010 and has since spread across many counties. Treatment efforts in the U.S. include restricting the movement of infested wood, applying pesticides, and introducing the same wasps from Asia that lay eggs in EAB larvae.

**Item 3: MC – Reasoning Selection 1: 7.LS2.2
DCI: LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics
SEP: SEP6: Constructing Explanations
Justification: Requires students to explain a broader ecological principle—how predator absence results in unchecked population growth. This aligns with SEP6 by demanding causal reasoning and synthesis of the predator-prey model.
CCC: CCC2: Cause and Effect
Justification: Students must identify how a lack of natural predators leads to exponential beetle population growth—a foundational ecological cause-effect pattern.
DOK Level: 3
Justification: Requires explaining how and why evidence supports the claim using an ecological model.

Question:
How does the presence or absence of predators affect the emerald ash borer population?

A) Predators help beetle larvae grow faster.
B) Without predators, the beetle population grows unchecked.
C) Predators prevent beetles from laying eggs in ash trees.
D) Without predators, beetles become less active and reproduce less.

Answer: B

Rationale for correct: 
B: Predators help control populations; their absence enables population explosions.

Rationale for incorrect:
A: Contradicts predator-prey dynamics.
C: Incorrect mechanism — predators do not inhibit egg-laying behavior.
D: Untrue — beetles reproduce more without predation.

**Item 4: MC – Reasoning Selection 2: 7.LS2.2
DCI: LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics
SEP: SEP6: Constructing Explanations
Justification: Students must project the long-term outcome of an ecological intervention (introducing predators), drawing on ecological understanding and using it to explain system behavior—a hallmark of SEP6.
CCC: CCC7: Stability and Change
Justification: Students evaluate how introducing a missing species can restore stability to an ecosystem undergoing change.
DOK Level: 4
Justification: Requires applying knowledge to evaluate a real-world solution strategy and predict systemic outcomes in a novel scenario.

Question:
If scientists successfully introduce Asian wasps across U.S. forests, what long-term outcome would BEST support the strategy’s effectiveness?

A) Fewer ash trees die each year and beetle populations begin to stabilize.
B) Scientists stop using pesticides completely across all forests.
C) Beetles migrate to other hardwood trees and avoid ash altogether.
D) Wasp populations outgrow beetles and begin damaging local crops.

Answer: A

Rationale for correct:
A; The system regains stability through predator introduction, reflected by tree recovery and beetle population balance.

Rationale for incorrect:
B: Not necessarily an indicator of predator success.
C: Implies a behavior shift not caused by wasps.
D: Describes a new problem — destabilization, not restoration.

# Constructed Response (CR)

### Constructed Response Item 1

Standard Chosen:
7.LS2.1: Develop a model to depict the cycling of matter, including carbon and oxygen, and the flow of energy among biotic and abiotic parts of an ecosystem.

CR Prompt:
Use scientific reasoning to explain how carbon and oxygen cycle through a forest ecosystem.

Your response must include:
A description of at least three components of the carbon or oxygen cycle (e.g., photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition).
An explanation of how both biotic and abiotic factors are involved.
A model (either written or labeled diagram) showing how matter and energy move through organisms and the environment.

Component Breakdown by DOK:
Component - DOK Level - DOK Verbs - Justification
1. Identify and describe 3 processes	- DOK 2 - Identify, describe - Requires students to summarize and differentiate among familiar processes — beyond recall, but not requiring strategic reasoning.
2. Explain interactions - DOK 3 - Explain, analyze - Requires students to analyze relationships between system components (biotic and abiotic) and reason through their roles.
3. Construct a model - DOK 3 - Construct, model - Requires synthesis of ideas to produce a system-level representation; modeling demands selection and organization of relevant information.

Overall DOK: 3


Tiered Rubric:
Tier: Description
Exceeding (4):	Comprehensive explanation with accurate descriptions of photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition; includes a labeled model showing biotic and abiotic interactions and matter/energy flow; uses correct terminology and strong reasoning.
Meets (3): Accurate explanation of at least two components; includes biotic and abiotic factors with some detail; model may have minor omissions but reasoning is clear.
Developing (2): Basic or partial explanation; may only reference biotic or abiotic factors; model is present but lacks clarity or contains some inaccuracies.
Emerging (1): Minimal or unclear explanation with little or no scientific vocabulary; model may be missing or incorrect.
No Response (0): No response or unrelated content.

Model Student Response (Exceeding):
In a forest ecosystem, carbon and oxygen cycle through photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition. During photosynthesis, plants (biotic) use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide (from the air, abiotic) into oxygen and glucose. Animals (biotic) then breathe in the oxygen and perform cellular respiration, releasing carbon dioxide back into the air. When organisms die, decomposers like fungi break them down, returning carbon to the soil and air. This cycle keeps matter and energy moving through both living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem.

Labeled Model (not shown here) would include arrows showing: CO₂ from air → plant (photosynthesis) → oxygen → animal (respiration) → CO₂ → decomposers → soil/air.

Constructed Response Item 2
Standard Chosen:
6.PS3.1: Analyze the movement of heat between objects by conduction, convection, and radiation.

CR Prompt:
Use scientific reasoning to explain why one type of cup keeps a drink colder than the other based on how energy is transferred.

Your response must include:

- A claim about which cup is better at keeping a drink cold.
- At least two pieces of evidence from the scenario to support your claim.
- A reasoning section that uses scientific ideas about energy transfer, insulation, and temperature change to connect the evidence to your claim.

Component Breakdown by DOK:
Component - DOK Level - DOK Verbs - Justification
1. Claim - DOK 1 - Identify - Requires student to make a factual determination based on presented data
2. Evidence - DOK 2 - Cite, describe - Requires selection and summarization of relevant observational evience.

Model Student Response (Exceeding)
Claim:
The foam cup is better at keeping drinks cold than the metal cup.

Evidence:
- After one hour, the water in the foam cup is colder (6°C) and still contains ice, while the metal cup’s water is warmer (18°C) and most ice has melted.
- The outside of the metal cup feels warm, but the foam cup feels cool.

Reasoning:
The foam cup slows the transfer of energy from the warm air outside to the cold water inside because it is a better insulator. Insulators reduce conduction, which is the transfer of heat through direct contact. Since less energy moved into the foam cup, the ice melted more slowly. In contrast, the metal cup allowed energy to pass through more easily, warming the water faster. This demonstrates how different materials affect energy transfer and temperature change.
